= Node.js on Raspberry Pi
Gary Dalton <https://github.com/gary-dalton>
:description: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications. It uses an asynchronous event driven framework that is designed to build scalable network applications. I install it on nearly all of my pi to provide a framework for building user interfaces that can actually do something.

After reading this guide, you may be interested in reading:


== Parts List

* Installed network connected Raspberry Pi 2 or newer


== Overview

Start with a Raspberry Pi image. This is an image saved after following the [RPi Initial Setup Guide](rpi_initial_setup.html). This may be either a lite or a full desktop image.


== Write the image

Write the image to the MicroSD as described in the [RPi Initial Setup Guide](rpi_initial_setup.html). Insert the MicroSD into the Pi and boot.


== Connect Pi to your Internet

Use an Ethernet cable to connect the pi to the network. DHCP will assign the pi an IP address. Find the address of your pi from your network's DHCP server.

* SSH to the pi at that IP address or yourpiname.local

== Install the node.js

Figure out which version of nodejs you wan to install. I usually use an LTS version. See versions available at https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/.

Then follow the installation instructions for your version from https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall. These should be a straight forward install for Raspberry Pi versions 2 and 3.

* Add and update sources, `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -`
* Install, `sudo apt-get install nodejs`

TIP: The pi uses the ARM processor. Determine which instruction set version is included, `grep 'model name' /proc/cpuinfo`. This output should include ARMv6, ARMv7, and so forth. The Raspberry Pi 3 uses the ARMv7 processor.


== Express framework

Express.js is one of the most essential web frameworks for Node.js. It is a minimalist framework for building a host of web and mobile applications as well as application programming interfaces (APIs). Express.js is offers various features, like template engines, simplified multiple routing, database integration and more.

* Install with `sudo npm install express --save`
